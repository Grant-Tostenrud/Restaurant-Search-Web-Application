# RestaurantAventure

This is an app that allows users to find a restaurant to go to in the U.S. Made for MindSumo challenge from Capital One.

You can see the app running here: https://afternoon-castle-41577.herokuapp.com/

This web app gives users the chance to enter in criteria and in turn, the app will generate a random restaurant that matches the criteria. It is an awesome way to take the decision making out of the users hands by putting it in the those of the app. The files used by the app are separated in folders. The server.py is the main app python file. The rest of the python files can be found in the src folder. The html files can be found in the templates folder.
Thank you!
